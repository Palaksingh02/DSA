    O---> Big oh (Worst case)
    O(1)----> constant e.g: int a = n; ------->O(1)------> kuchh constant kaam ho rha hai 
    O(n)---------> when the program takes n traversals it depends on user input
    Nested loops that is loop within a loop have generally a convention of O(n^2) but it is not
    necessary that it will happen always open your eyes and have a proper look
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<3;j++){
            System.out.println(arr[i][j]);
        } // This loop runs always 3 for every value of i
    }// This loop will run n times

    Total no. of iterations = 3*n-----------> O(3n)==O(n)
